# Updating the Website
Simply edit the `docs/` folder in `r0hin/parallelcode`. Upon push, the live website will be updated as it points to GitHub pages at `r0hin.github.io/parallelcode`.

Importantly, preserve the version number and join buttons so that app downloads remain.

The attached JavaScript file is at `docs/assets/index.js` and CSS is at `docs/assets/index.css`. 

Preserve the `preview.html` and `js`/`css` folders as they pertain to Parallel's playlist/album public link feature.
